# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.
Hi, my name is Ivan Maldonado, and I'm learning how to use GitHub. This isn't my first time learning about it, but this is the first time I'm excited to know about it. When I first interacted with GitHub, I was in college. I didn't care at all about it, but now I think it is a super useful tool to organize your code. The main reason why I'm learning how to use GitHub is because I want to manage my code.
